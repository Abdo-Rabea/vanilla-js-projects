## Why Vanilla JS?

This repo emphasizes learning by building. Vanilla JavaScript helps you:
- Understand the core web APIs (DOM, Events, Fetch, etc.)
- Gain confidence before moving on to frameworks like React
- Build projects with zero dependencies

---
## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
No build tools. No frameworks. 100% vanilla.
